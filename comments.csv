11022768,tuvistavie,"To answer the questions of the use case, here is mine.
I spend quite a lot of time editing in Chrome, especially Github and StackOverflow, and found myself doing the following:<p>* Start editing in Chrome<p>* It becomes long so copy-paste to Atom and edit there<p>* Copy-paste back to Chrome<p>To avoid this, I have then be using <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;wasavi&#x2F;dgogifpkoilgiofhhhodbodcfgomelhe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;wasavi&#x2F;dgogifpkoil...</a> to edit directly in Chrome but thought that it would be better to use a real editor rather than a subset, which is why I created this package.<p>I have an editor opened almost all the time, so pressing a shortcut and being able to edit directly there without copy-pasting around is actually saving me some time compared to my previous workflows."
11023609,lftl,"Just wanted to say thanks for It&#x27;s All Text, it&#x27;s been a huge timesaver for me."
11023398,docwhat,I like this idea. As Firefox tightens its sandbox security eventually things like It&#x27;s All Text! won&#x27;t work anymore.<p>I have some bugs open on the project and maybe someday I can switch from Vim to Atom comfortably.<p>I also hear that the It&#x27;s All Text! author is lazy... every time I go home to the family. ;-)
11023331,ben336,Atom has a very good vim-mode that implements vim key bindings.  You can do similar things to get emacs or custom key-bindings
11023280,tuvistavie,"Atom is a full featured text editor, like vim or emacs.
The editing experience is therefore way superior to Firefox or Chrome textarea,
and you can use all the shortcuts, plugins and goodies you are used to.
For a short comment, a basic textarea is of course enough,
but when you write something a little longer,
I think it is a real gain of time to be able to edit in a real editor."
11023462,JoshTriplett,"I use and recommend It&#x27;s All Text as well, but Atom <i>is</i> a programmer&#x27;s editor, and if someone prefers Atom as their editor of choice, they&#x27;d find it a massive improvement over a browser textarea."
11023638,rickycook,"OP never said better though. I think the point was merely that vim is always a very different editing experience, where atom by default is not"
11023435,omaranto,"&gt; <i>atom, which presents an extremely similar text editing experience compared to the experience the text area already provided</i><p>Well, that&#x27;s just rude. Atom is a customizable, programmable, featureful text editor. You can certainly believe that Vim is better, but you shouldn&#x27;t think that on the spectrum from browser textarea to Vim, Atom is close the textarea side."
11023127,SwellJoe,"I use It&#x27;s All Text! with gvim, as well. It&#x27;s a great tool when I have a lot of updates to do in large documents. That said, there is a vim mode for Atom, and this seemingly has the minor benefit of live updates to the textarea.<p>I suspect there are use cases where this makes sense, and, obviously, Atom is a more powerful editor than a browser textarea, though the key bindings may be similar."
11023128,CaptSpify,"I do the same as you, and I&#x27;ve never used atom. Maybe it has shortcuts or other similar configs that might be preferable to the standard text-box?"
11022734,Sir_Cmpwn,"I use this Firefox add-on to edit text in gvim from time to time:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;its-all-text&#x2F;?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;its-all-text&#x2F;...</a><p>But I don&#x27;t see the advantage of editing text areas with atom, which presents an extremely similar text editing experience compared to the experience the text area already provided. On the other hand, moving to Vim to edit a particuarly long comment or what have you makes more sense because I get to use the crazy keybindings I&#x27;ve drilled into my fingers."

11023499,tedmiston,Awesome!  I&#x27;m happy to help test - email in profile.
11023153,tuvistavie,"Totally agree. I am going to give it a try.

11022791,sridca,"It would be even cooler if HTML input can be edited using markdown source.<p>For eg., you compile an email in Gmail, but edit it using Markdown in Atom (or whatever editor); the final content gets rendered as HTML. Effectively you are sending HTML email that was composed and edited in Markdown."
11022792,sandisk5,"Use cases I thought of and I haven&#x27;t even used it or similar plugins:<p>You want to use Atom&#x27;s Markdown preview of a reddit comment or a github issue or anything else that takes Markdown.<p>You want autosave of a comment&#x2F;input in case you accidentally close the tab, navigate away, or restart your browser.<p>You want to write code in a comment&#x2F;email.<p>You want to use more advanced editing commands, things like undo-tree."
11023174,krisdol,"Yes. For one, I don&#x27;t trust myself to not accidentally hit a keyboard shortcut I&#x27;m used to using on my native editor, but happens to collide with an important function in the email client. I also despise gmail&#x27;s interface in general these days."

11022829,ericfrederich,"I wind up copying text into Sublime all the time to do my formatting then paste it back into my browser.<p>Things like GitLab, GitHub, Bugzilla, Wikis, etc.

11022806,Myztiq,"The only real use-case I can see here is getting access to multi-select, and find&#x2F;replace utilities, or perhaps other custom shortcuts you might use. Overall a neat little trick. Atom is not my usual editor of choice but I could see a few small potential use cases."

Not in Times Square.<p>When done right and with the right people it can be a truly profound experience which I firmly firmly believe all humans should participate in. I&#x27;ve heard just as many people though turned off to them permanently though through bad experiences which I (who am likely biased) chalk up to bad settings.

I find other unscholarly attempts to be a bit vague and artificially &#x27;mystical&#x27;. Scholarly translations are great because they really try to put the work in context and preserve its delicate meanings. That&#x27;s rather important considering that the text, like many ancient writings has been corrupted through transmission and interpolation, and translation is fundamentally lossy."

11023575,danharaj,"It&#x27;s a tired cliche to share one&#x27;s fundamentally incommunicable drug experiences in the comments when the topic comes up, is it not? Let&#x27;s have a go at it.<p>The author paints an image of conflict between himself on lsd, and himself off lsd. Himself the perceiver, and himself the analyzer. I don&#x27;t think these are integral to the experience. He mentions perceptions like &#x27;...the notion of “teetering” was meaningless too—I was on both sides of the precipice at once&#x27;. I can identify this dissolution of boundaries and commingling of opposites in my own experiences. If you try to interpret the experience in terms of dichotomies and distinctions, your words will be inadequate to describe it. The inadequacy of such understanding might agitate you. There is something here for the analytical mind to gain too: learning to coexist with uncertainty, doubt, paradox, and mystery and yet keep going and keep analyzing. You don&#x27;t have to lose your head on LSD, but you&#x27;ll find in the deepest places that there is no distinction at all between the analyzer and the dreamer.<p>In regular old life, too, I believe that distinctions, drawing a line between &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; can be as much a handicap to understanding as an aid. Distinctions tell things apart, but unity and continuity are as integral to reality as difference and change. The wholeness of being engendered by psychedelic experiences is difficult to describe because distinctions are the easy aspect of language, and wholeness the difficult. True ugliness and true beauty walk hand in hand in that strange place. It does one well to let go of the distinction between good and bad when one is on a trip. Forcing it won&#x27;t help though. &quot;Have you ever <i>tried</i> to relax? It is a paradox!&quot;<p>I read Laozi for the first time at the end of a &quot;bad&quot; trip. It was a joy. To this day, it is the only text that makes perfect sense to me in the waking world and that other world, the world of dreams. That was my last trip.

It was never illegal to use such a code and transmit the result on a letter, postcard, or phone.  And a government warrant would not compel the decipherment of such a scheme, unless someone had possession of a physical key usable for decipherment.<p>The two differences now: we&#x27;ve made that technology available to non-experts, and we <i>hope</i> that no amount of government effort can crack the scheme (as opposed to obtaining the key).<p>I agree with your comment that it&#x27;s not a &quot;fake crisis&quot;, though.  It&#x27;s one with only one right answer, but it&#x27;s a &quot;crisis&quot; in the sense that no possible path forward will make both parties happy, so we fundamentally need the government to either realize they&#x27;re wrong or to lose.

11023413,fleitz,"Incorrect, if the key is shared the encryption is breakable.

11023396,therealmarv,Why is this so much upvoted? This is old news. IMHO ngxpagespeed is a good option if you have a lot of old legacy stuff which cannot be converted for a good web compression nowadays.<p>But compiling your own nginx is not trivial and I would not recommend it for everyone.<p>It would be great if there would be a great precompiled nginx with newest security fixes for my Ubuntu which can enable ngxpagespeed or the new brotli compression: This is missing in the open source world.
11023320,ComputerGuru,"We ran this in production from its initial release over two years ago. Last month, we moved to a new datacenter and decided to forgo ngxpagespeed entirely.<p>The results have long been mixed - it does a great job minifying content and reducing requests, but the net results are highly questionable. While we reduced our network transfers and round-trips, the amount of time it took to serve requests was significantly increased to a point where the net gains were minimal. We played around with enabling and disabling the various filters and changing the settings and configurations to a great extent, and filed quite a few issues with the (ngx)pagespeed teams as we came across them.<p>If you do use this module, don&#x27;t enable image recompression. It&#x27;ll use up a lot of CPU, but worse, it&#x27;ll also add significant latency to your requests. The caches on disk will always be full, and your disk IO will increase across the board. My personal favorite filter was the CSS merger which pulls various CSS resources into a single file. My favorite feature that always let me down was the &quot;prioritize critical CSS&quot; filter which (in theory) inlines CSS needed for above-the-fold content to display immediately. It never worked reliably for us, and broke our CSS more times than I can count. We always went back every few months to try it and always came away disappointed.<p>ngxpagespeed does not play well with caching (it must be enabled on the outer-most node) as it relies on realtime metrics collected via JS from served pages to make decisions about content, caching, inlining, and more. It also doesn&#x27;t work well for SEO without significant manual tuning as it rewrites content URLs (I hear there is a way around this on Apache, but not on nginx) to pass back information to nginx, appending .pagespeed.xxxxx to your non-HTML URLs, including images that will be picked up by Google&#x27;s bots. If you disable pagespeed later, all these will be broken. There&#x27;s also no guarantee that these links will remain valid across pagespeed versions or if you enable&#x2F;disable certain ngxpagespeed modules&#x2F;filters, though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been bitten by that (solution: you need to hack your nginx configuration to always include a Link...canonical header in your outgoing requests).<p>There are open issues galore regarding HTTPS and ngxpagespeed - it&#x27;s an ongoing battle to make it play nicely with HTTPS upstreams for caching. It also basically proxies all requests made to your site back to your site once more so it can cache and optimize them, adding an entire roundtrip to initial or uncached requests. By default it won&#x27;t cache HTML, so all HTML pages get proxied an extra time. There&#x27;s an option to disable this for static resources by loading them from disk instead, but good luck getting that to play nicely with multiple upstreams and overlapping paths taking advantage of rewrite rules.<p>In the end, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it for us. We&#x27;ve configured our webapp to pull in, minify, and inline its own (entire) CSS on first page load (about 20 lines of code w&#x2F; the Yahoo minify library doing the crunching), then configured nginx to reduce latency (http2, ssl_buffer_size, ssl session caching, smart keepalives, gzip, ssl_cipher optimizations (hint: bigger isn&#x27;t better), proper expire headers, MTU optimization, etc) and the results have been better than what ngxpagespeed was giving us.<p>Sorry for how unstructured this comment is, I&#x27;ve been remembering stuff as I go along. By all means, ngxpagespeed is an awesome effort. As a primarily non-web developer, I think this is what browsers and http servers should do by default: act as a compiler of sorts for your content and find and implement optimizations where possible because your job isn&#x27;t to figure out how to minimize network requests but rather to write code that works. However, it&#x27;s the early days of &quot;web compilers&quot; and the intelligence and logic is far from being any good just yet. Just like 30 years ago no compiler could come close to even an average developer&#x27;s hand-crafted (not even tuned!) assembly, that&#x27;s how I see the state of &quot;optimizing&quot; proxies today. Give it another decade or two, I suppose :)"

However that tends to get learned the hard way. Those lazy loading images were working a treat on Friday, come monday - ah, no Apple users could see any images, consequently in an instant Pagespeed gets removed.<p>To take an automotive analogy, Pagespeed is a bit like doing things to a car for improved &#x27;performance&#x27;. Let&#x27;s save weight, let&#x27;s put some active suspension in there, let&#x27;s remove a few bits to improve the aero, let&#x27;s put some 100 octane fuel in the tank and chuck in some twin turbo. All these improvements - let&#x27;s keep going there are 50 more tweaks we can do in the garage, why not try 38 of them at once? What could possibly go wrong?<p>So, the main problem with Pagespeed is not how it works it is just that it encourages people to keep going with it, layering on more &#x27;improvements&#x27; until the website does the computing equivalent of leaving the road to spontaneously burst into flames."

11023556,Riod,Why the assumption that BABA keeps declining in value? Shareholders probably have more faith in BABA than Yahoo core. Would make sense to sell core yahoo and keep Yahoo Japan and BABA under the Yahoo ticker. Reason being the tax from selling the latter two affects your PV more if you believe they will keep growing.
11023470,henrikschroder,"It&#x27;s interesting that the Alibaba holdings are more of a liability than an asset in this situation.<p>YHOO is essentially a proxy for BABA, nothing Yahoo does affects the stock price in any meaningful way, and the value of the core business is effectively negative, if you subtract the post-tax value of Alibaba, Yahoo Japan, and cash on hand. But the value of a declining business with billions in revenue each year must be positive.<p>So selling off Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is the best bet, except you have investors demanding that it be done tax-free, so you can&#x27;t just sell them, even though the decline of the value of Alibaba during the time it takes to do this process might be larger than the taxes. If Alibaba keeps going down in value, selling it now gives you more money than selling it tax-free in the future. But that might still get you sued by the shareholders, which is stupid.<p>A reverse spin-off, i.e. selling the core business, has some funny implications as well. Many employees are on work visas, which are tied to a specific employer at a specific address. If this changes, all of those visas become invalid. Obviously, selling the assets and shrinking the market cap, would make it much easier for someone to buy Yahoo."
