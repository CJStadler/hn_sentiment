11027178,tptacek,"<i>The craft was used in controversial US ‘rendition’ missions</i><p>This is apparently true, but misleading. The specific plane we&#x27;re discussing was used by the CIA, but by this point had been transferred to DOJ for some time.<p>It&#x27;s also misleading to use the word &quot;rendition&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; (which is itself newspeak for &quot;kidnapping&quot;). &quot;Rendition&quot; itself is simply the process of effectuating extradition. The term &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; is doubly Orwellian, because &quot;rendition&quot; is the word for what a <i>host jurisdiction</i> does. A government cooperating in extradition <i>renders</i> subjects. The CIA <i>kidnapped</i> people, apparently without engaging any process of the host government.<p>To make matters worse, the CIA&#x27;s kidnapping program sent terrorism subjects to <i>foreign jurisdictions</i>, allegedly (and almost certainly) to enable them to be interrogated by the norms of countries that weren&#x27;t squeamish about coercive, torturous interrogations. The USG wanted Snowden back on US soil.<p>I suppose there&#x27;s a coherent argument to be made that the US should have destroyed the CIA&#x27;s torture charter jet, and that any further use of that particular piece of equipment is tainted by its history. To me, it&#x27;s just a plane, and if we&#x27;re going to do something drastic in response to the CIA&#x27;s complicity (and participation) in torture, that thing should probably be a series of criminal prosecutions.<p>Either way, the implication that Snowden was targeted for extrajudicial kidnapping isn&#x27;t supported by any evidence presented so far. So far, the facts we know about support a pretty boring narrative: the USG knew it was going to charge Snowden with crimes for which most of Europe would comply with extradition, and sent a DOJ plane to streamline that process.<p>It&#x27;s hard to blame media outlets for reporting like this, because the story of how we came to know that this particular plane had participated in the CIA&#x27;s kidnapping scheme makes for really good reading. But it&#x27;s still important to know the whole story.<p>And this particular headline is pretty silly. Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, proprietors of GCHQ, the west&#x27;s most unhinged signals intelligence agency. A DOJ plane flying over Scotland to fetch a SIGINT leaker isn&#x27;t particularly newsworthy."

11027379,krapp,"Not to be paranoid and cynical, but we don&#x27;t actually know that Edward Snowden, <i>personally</i>, is still maintaining that account, even though the account was verified."
